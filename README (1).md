# Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan Report

## üìå Objective

The objective of this task is to perform a basic vulnerability scan on
my PC using free tools such as **OpenVAS** or **Nessus Essentials**.\
The goal is to identify common vulnerabilities, understand their
severity, and document possible mitigations.

## üõ† Tools Used

-   Nessus Essentials (Free Vulnerability Scanner)\
-   Operating System: Windows 10\
-   Target: Localhost (127.0.0.1)

## üîç Steps Performed

1.  Installed Nessus Essentials and registered with an activation code.\
2.  Configured localhost (127.0.0.1) as the scan target.\
3.  Launched a full vulnerability scan.\
4.  Waited for the scan to complete (\~45 minutes).\
5.  Reviewed the report for vulnerabilities and severity levels.

## üìë Analysis

-   **Critical Issue:** SMBv1 service, linked to ransomware like
    WannaCry.\
-   Weak TLS and outdated browsers increase MITM attack risks.\
-   Open RDP port could allow brute-force attacks.

## üõ° Mitigation / Fixes

-   Disable SMBv1 and upgrade to SMBv2/3.\
-   Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.\
-   Keep browsers and apps updated.\
-   Restrict RDP access or disable if not needed.\
-   Regularly apply Windows Updates.

## üéØ Key Concepts Learned

-   Vulnerability scanning basics.\
-   CVSS scoring system.\
-   Remediation techniques.\
-   Importance of continuous scanning.

## ‚ùì Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What is vulnerability scanning?**\
A: Identifying security weaknesses in systems using automated tools.

**Q2: Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing?**\
A: Scanning detects issues; penetration testing exploits them to assess
impact.

**Q3: What are some common vulnerabilities in PCs?**\
A: Unpatched software, weak passwords, outdated services, open ports.

**Q4: How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?**\
A: By comparing system configs/software versions with known
vulnerability databases.

**Q5: What is CVSS?**\
A: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (0--10 scale for severity).

**Q6: How often should vulnerability scans be performed?**\
A: Monthly or after major updates/changes.

**Q7: What is a false positive in scanning?**\
A: When a scanner flags a non-existent vulnerability.

**Q8: How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?**\
A: Based on severity (CVSS), exploitability, and impact on critical
systems.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience in vulnerability scanning.\
I learned how to detect critical vulnerabilities, interpret CVSS scores,
and suggest mitigations.\
Regular scanning is essential for maintaining strong system security.
